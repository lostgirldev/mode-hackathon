## Story Protocol Implementation Report

### Overview

This report analyzes the codebase provided to assess the implementation of features related to the Story Protocol. The assessment focuses on the presence of key functionalities, proper integration of the `@story-protocol/core-sdk`, and overall code quality in relation to the Story Protocol's concepts.

### Features Implemented

Based on the provided codebase, here's what features seem implemented.

*   **No direct usage of Story Protocol SDK:** There's NO direct implementation of Story Protocol's SDK (i.e. `@story-protocol/core-sdk`) in the given codebase. The codebase seems focused on setting up a front-end application with backend API endpoints for functionalities unrelated to the Story Protocol. There's NO smart contract interaction code, or IP management code.

### Quality of Implementation

Since no direct usage of the Story Protocol SDK was found, there is no quality of implementation to asses.

### General Codebase Quality Related to Story Protocol

Given the absence of Story Protocol-related code, there's no basis to evaluate the codebase's quality concerning its usage. The codebase appears to be a standard React application with a Node.js/Express backend, focusing on blockchain monitoring, security analysis, and wallet integration with services like Crossmint, and AI integration via EternalAI and Deepseek. It includes robust UI components, API endpoint setup, and some blockchain interaction logic (through ethers), but does not involve any IP Asset or license management using Story Protocol.

### Conclusion

The analyzed codebase does not include any direct implementations of the Story Protocol. Therefore, no specific assessment can be made regarding the proper use, or quality, of it's implementation.
